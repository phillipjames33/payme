# **App Name**: DebtDuel

## Core Features:

- Social Profile Setup: Users can create a profile page to showcase their services (e.g., Uber driver, barber).
- Direct Payment Processing: Enable users to directly accept payments and bookings through their profile page using secure payment gateways.
- Debt Posting (The Duel): Allow users to post about a debt owed without revealing the exact amount; other users can guess the amount.
- Guess Validation: Indicate whether a guess is close to the actual debt owed (e.g., container lights up red or green, use the tool to decide).
- Debt Leaderboard: Display a leaderboard ranking users by total debt owed (amount and time since debt start).
- Automated Collections Agent: The AI agent can be authorized to reach out to debtors via email and text, based on information provided by the lender.
- Gamified User Interface: Implement game-like elements throughout the app to enhance user engagement, with badges and achievements.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL (45, 90%, 50%) - A vibrant gold (#F7BC0F) to represent value, rewards, and the gamified elements of debt collection.
- Background color: HSL (45, 20%, 95%) - A light, desaturated yellow (#F2F1EB) for a soft, inviting background that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: HSL (15, 70%, 50%) - A warm coral (#E6774A) to draw attention to calls to action and highlight important elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to give a techy and fun feel; 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text for legibility. 
- Use custom icons with a line art style to represent each service category and debt-related action. Icons should be modern, minimalist, and easily recognizable.
- Implement a clean, card-based layout with ample whitespace to make content scannable and improve user experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions, such as when a guess is submitted or a payment is processed.
